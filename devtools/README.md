# DevTools

Foundry scripts glued together to simulate marketplace activity. Computes a start block (default: 28 days ago) and forks mainnet at that block. Once your `.env` is in order, `make execute-pipeline` runs the whole thing.

- Deploys orderbook + demo NFT collections
- Bootstraps accounts derived from the provided mnemonic
- Generates realistic-looking orders and signs them EIP-712 style
- Settles a subset of orders, with probability decay leaving some unfilled

## Overview

Built to simulate marketplace activity for an interactive demo. Later grew into something more generic — may be useful to devs wanting production-like activity for demos, testing, or stakeholder previews.

**The fork**

We fork mainnet instead of a blank chain. Currencies like WETH live at their real addresses, and trade receipts contain realistic block numbers.

**Participants**

Participants are derived from a mnemonic. Default participant count is 10, but can be increased / decreased without breaking the pipeline.

Participants are funded during fork startup through Anvil's --mnemonic flag.

Scripts that need to read participants extend [BaseDevScript](./BaseDevScript.s.sol) — e.g. for allowance and transfer approvals. The `actor` field of every generated order or fill is one of the participant addresses.

**The data**

After bootstrapping participants with WETH and NFTs, and doing the necessary approvals, the pipeline creates and signs EIP-712 orders, and then executes trades on a subset of these.

This multi-step process happens per-epoch. Each epoch stores its generated orders and related pipeline state in its own directory.

---

## Epochs

An epoch is a time slice of the pipeline window. The **delta** (`pipeline_end_ts - pipeline_start_ts`) is divided into `EPOCH_COUNT` equal **slices** (`epoch_slice = delta / EPOCH_COUNT`).

Each epoch builds, exports, and settles orders within its slice, advancing Anvil block time accordingly.

**What happens inside one epoch:**

- **Sampling** —Orders are generated from deterministic inputs (collection, side, epoch, etc.), so the simulation gets variation while still producing reproducible results. In short, same input &rarr; same output.
- **Signing** — Signs orders.
- **Export** — Pushes orders to an optional endpoint. Gated behind the `--export` flag, off by default, enabled by the root `Makefile`.
- **Execution** — ...

## Where to Start

Skim these in order to build a mental model without reading everything:

| #   | File                             | What you learn                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **`Makefile`** (targets section) | The full pipeline as named steps — what runs, in what order, and what each phase is called.                                                                    |
| 2   | **`DevConfig.s.sol`**            | All the config knobs in one place — read this to better understand the pipeline context.                                                                       |
| 3   | **`runners/run-epochs.sh`**      | The epoch loop in four labelled phases: BUILD → EXPORT → CHOOSE → EXECUTE. The probability decay logic is visible here too.                                    |
| 4   | `BuildEpoch.s.sol`               | Implements the BUILD phase — generates and signs orders for a single epoch. Its dense; skim `run` then follow `_buildOrders` into `MarketSim`. Just forget the |

**Going deeper:**

| Topic              | Read                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sampling           | `MarketSim.sol`                                                                 |
| Order signing      | `SignOrder.s.sol`                                                               |
| Bootstrap sequence | `DeployCore` → `BootstrapAccounts` → `BootstrapNFTs` → `Approve` in that order. |

The boostrap sequence is especially good for anyone new to foundry. They're very straight forward.

## Setup

**Dependencies**

| Tool                       | Version | Notes |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Foundry (forge/cast/anvil) | \_\_\_  |       |
| curl                       |         |       |
| jq                         |         |       |

**Run**

Per now, the scripts are not generic enough to accept just any marketplace. Anyone may use whatever they want from this repo and adapt them to their own contracts.

To run the pipeline as is, with `OrderEngine.sol`, run the entrypoint `make` command:

```
make execute-pipeline
```

This command computes the fork window, starts anvil, deploys, bootstraps, and runs all epochs. Export is off by default. If `ORDER_POST_URL` is set in your `.env`, enable it with `make execute-pipeline EXPORT=1`.

You can call any of the available commands from project root or from `devtools` directory. To see a reference of available targets:

```
make help
```

> [!NOTE]
> To run the full demo environment — including the frontend and indexer — see [dmrkt-compose](REPO_URL). That repo has its own setup and uses `compose-entrypoint` from this Makefile instead of `execute-pipeline`.
