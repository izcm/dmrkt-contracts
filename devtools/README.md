# DevTools

Foundry scripts glued together to simulate marketplace activity. Computes a start block (default: 28 days ago) and forks mainnet at that block. The pipeline goes like:

- Deploys orderbook + demo NFT collections
- Bootstraps accounts derived from the provided mnemonic
- Generates realistic-looking orders and signs them EIP-712 style
- Settles a subset of orders per epoch, with probability decay to leave some unfilled

```

## Overview

Built to simulate marketplace activity for an interactive demo. Later grew into something more generic — may be useful to devs wanting production-like activity for demos, testing, or stakeholder previews.

**The fork**

We fork mainnet instead of a blank chain. Currencies like WETH live at their real addresses, and trade receipts contain realistic block numbers.

**Participants**

Participants are derived from a mnemonic. Default participant count is 10, but can be increased / decreased without breaking the pipeline.

Participants are funded during fork startup through Anvil's --mnemonic flag.

Scripts that need to read participants extend [BaseDevScript](./BaseDevScript.s.sol) — e.g. for allowance and transfer approvals. The `actor` field of every generated order or fill is one of the participant addresses.

**The data**

After bootstrapping participants with WETH and NFTs, and doing the necessary approvals, the pipeline deterministically creates and signs EIP-712 orders, and then executes trades on a subset of these.

This multi-step process happens per-epoch. Each epoch stores its generated orders and related pipeline state in its own directory.

---

## Epochs

An epoch is a time slice of the pipeline window. The **delta** (`pipeline_end_ts - pipeline_start_ts`) is divided into `EPOCH_COUNT` equal **slices** (`epoch_slice = delta / EPOCH_COUNT`).

Each epoch builds, exports, and settles orders within its slice, advancing Anvil block time accordingly.

**What happens inside one epoch:**

- **Sampling** —Orders are generated from deterministic inputs (collection, side, epoch, etc.), so the simulation gets variation while still producing reproducible results. In short, same input &rarr; same output.
- **Signing** — Signs orders.
- **Export** — Pushes orders to an optional endpoint. Gated behind the `--export` flag, off by default, enabled by the root `Makefile`.
- **Execution** — ...

## Where to Start

Skim these in order to build a mental model without reading everything:

| #   | File                             | What you learn                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **`Makefile`** (targets section) | The full pipeline as named steps — what runs, in what order, and what each phase is called.                                                    |
| 2   | **`DevConfig.s.sol`**            | All the config knobs in one place — read this to better understand the pipeline context.                                                       |
| 3   | **`runners/run-epochs.sh`**      | The epoch loop in four labelled phases: BUILD → EXPORT → CHOOSE → EXECUTE. The probability decay logic is visible here too.                    |
| 4   | `BuildEpoch.s.sol`               | Implements the BUILD phase — generates and signs orders for a single epoch. Dense; skim `run` then follow `_buildOrders` into `OrderSampling`. |

**Going deeper:**

| Topic              | Read                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sampling           | `OrderSampling.s.sol`                                                           |
| Order signing      | `SettlementSigner.s.sol`                                                        |
| Bootstrap sequence | `DeployCore` → `BootstrapAccounts` → `BootstrapNFTs` → `Approve` in that order. |

The boostrap sequence is especially good for anyone new to foundry. They're very straight forward.
